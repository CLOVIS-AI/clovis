/**
 * Common interface for API endpoints.
 *
 * A [Provider] represents all endpoints for a specific data type (for example, a wallet).
 * Each method represents a different endpoint to implement actions on the relevant objects (list all objects, create a new oneâ€¦).
 *
 * The [Provider] interface only enforces two common contracts:
 * - [directRequest]: How to query an object from the backend from its ID (see [Ref]).
 * - [cache]: How to temporarily store fetched data on the client-side, to decrease the number of requests.
 *
 * Apart from the [directRequest] method, no method should return an API object.
 * Instead, all methods should return a [reference][Ref] on the object, so each reference can be requested individually through the cache.
